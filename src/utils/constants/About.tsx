I am a self-motivated and goal-oriented Data Analyst with a passion for data-driven insights and a strong 
foundation in Economics, Statistics, and Mathematics. I possess technical skills in 
contemporary software, coupled with excellent communication and research abilities.
If you have the data, I have the insights for you.
I have a passion for music, poetry, and sportsâ€”whether I'm writing verses, enjoying a Netflix marathon, or playing badminton.

I completed a 3-month internship in the Business Intelligence department, gaining hands-on experience in data analysis and reporting at **[Raise Financial Services](https://raiseholding.co/)**. If you have a project that you want to get started, think you need my help with something, or just fancy saying hello, then **[get in touch](#contact)**.
